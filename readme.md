# Emotion-Detection

This project was created for submission to Dr. Seemab Latif, professor at NUST. 
## Dependencies

* Python 3, [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/), [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
* To install the required packages, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Basic Usage

The project is currently compatible with `tensorflow-2.0` and makes use of the Keras API using the `tensorflow.keras` library.

* First, clone the repository and enter the folder

```
git clone https://github.com/atulapra/Emotion-detection.git
cd Emotion-detection
```

* Download the FER-2013 dataset from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X60B-uR3NtqPd4oosdotpbDgy8KOfUdr/view?usp=sharing) and unzip it inside the `src` folder. This will create the folder `data`.

* If you want to train this model, use:  

```
cd src
python emotions.py --mode train
```

* If you want to view live working of the project then run:  

```
cd src
python emotions.py --mode display
```

* The folder structure is of the form:  
  src:
  * data (folder)
  * `emotions.py` (file)
  * `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml` (file)
  * `model.h5` (file)
